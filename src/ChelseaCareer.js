           <p>Drogba moved to England’s Chelsea FC in 2004 in a trade from Marseille. Though Chelsea won its first Premier League championship in 50 years the following season, its new centre-forward was inconsistent. Drogba was quick, alert, and supremely confident in his own ability, though he showed a tendency to a quick temper in matches. Even in his second season, when Chelsea’s title was successfully defended, fan appreciation was still muted. Yet by the end of the 2006–07 season, when Chelsea failed in its attempt to take a third straight league championship, Drogba had won over most of the skeptical Chelsea fans by being the league’s top scorer (with 20 goals) and by finishing the season with an overall tally of 33 goals. In addition, he was the key player in Chelsea’s winning both the Football Association (FA) Cup and Carling Cup trophies that season, as he scored the club’s only goals in the finals of those two tournaments. Drogba helped lead Chelsea to the 2008 Champions League final, where he once again earned fan ire by slapping an opposing player and getting sent off in a match that Chelsea ultimately lost to Manchester United by one penalty kick. In 2009 he earned a measure of redemption as Chelsea won its second FA Cup with Drogba on the squad. The following year Chelsea won both the FA Cup and the Premier League title, with Drogba leading the league in goals—29 for the season. In the 2012 Champions League final, he scored Chelsea’s lone regulation goal and the winning extra-time penalty kick to guide Chelsea past Bayern Munich and capture the team’s first European club championship.</p>
