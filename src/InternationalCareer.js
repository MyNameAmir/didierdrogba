In 2006 he captained Côte d’Ivoire to the African Cup of Nations final match, where the team lost to Egypt on penalty kicks. His performance in the qualifying matches for the 2006 World Cup was key to Drogba’s winning that year’s African Footballer of the Year award, as his nine goals in eight preliminary matches catapulted the Ivorians into the World Cup for the first time.

In 2012 he captained his country to a runners-up finish at the Cup of Nations and helped Côte d’Ivoire qualify for the 2014 World Cup, where his team, Les Éléphants, agonizingly missed out on advancing to the tournament’s knockout stage for the first time by conceding a stoppage-time goal on a penalty kick in its final group-stage match. Shortly thereafter Drogba announced that he was retiring from international play.</p>
